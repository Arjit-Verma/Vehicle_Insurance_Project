      <h2>Overview:</h2>
      <p>
        The Third-Party Liability Policy is a type of auto insurance that
        provides coverage for damages caused to third parties by your vehicle.
        It is designed to protect you financially in case your vehicle causes
        bodily injury or property damage to others in an accident for which you
        are deemed responsible.
      </p>

      <h2>Coverage Details:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bodily Injury Coverage:</strong> This aspect of the policy
          covers medical expenses, rehabilitation costs, and other related
          expenses for injuries sustained by third parties due to an accident
          involving your vehicle. It provides financial protection for the
          injured party's physical well-being.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Property Damage Coverage:</strong> This coverage pays for the
          repair or replacement costs of third-party property that has been

          damage to vehicles, buildings, fences, or other structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Expenses:</strong> In the event of a lawsuit arising
          from an accident, this policy may cover legal fees, court costs, and
          other related expenses incurred in defending yourself against
          third-party claims. It helps protect you from the financial burden of
          legal proceedings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Injury Protection (PIP):</strong> Some Third-Party
          Liability Policies may include Personal Injury Protection (PIP)
          coverage, which provides medical expenses and lost wages coverage for
          you and your passengers, regardless of fault. This additional coverage
          enhances the financial protection provided by the policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cost:</h2>
