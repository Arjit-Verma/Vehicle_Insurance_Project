      <h2>Overview:</h2>
      <p>
        Comprehensive coverage is a type of auto insurance that covers damage to
        your vehicle from incidents other than collisions. It's sometimes called
        "comp" or "other than collision" insurance. This policy offers extensive
        protection for your vehicle, providing peace of mind knowing that you're
        financially protected in various scenarios.
      </p>

      <h2>Coverage Details:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Accidents:</strong> Comprehensive coverage protects your
          vehicle from damages resulting from accidents. Whether it's a fender
          bender or a major collision, this policy will cover the cost of
          repairing or replacing your vehicle.
        </li>
        <!-- Other list items omitted for brevity -->
      </ul>

      <h2>Cost:</h2>
      <p>
        The premium for comprehensive coverage typically depends on various
        factors, including the value of your vehicle, your driving history,
        deductible amount, and location. The cost may vary, but for a policy
        offering comprehensive coverage at 25000rs/year, you can expect
        comprehensive protection for your vehicle at a reasonable rate.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
      <p>
        Investing in a comprehensive coverage policy provides you with extensive
        protection for your vehicle beyond what basic liability insurance
        offers. With coverage for accidents, theft, vandalism, weather events,
        and more, this policy offers peace of mind knowing that you're
        financially safeguarded in various situations.
